4959,1662,recipe,0.25,"Whole Wheat Penne with Kale and Tossed Breadcrumbs Ingredients:

• 2 large bunches kale
• DeLallo Natural Coarse Sea Salt
• 1/4 cup DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil, plus more for finishing
• 3 cloves garlic
• 1 cup DeLallo Traditional Breadcrumbs
• 1 (1-pound) package DeLallo Organic Whole-Wheat Penne Rigate
• 4 DeLallo Anchovy Fillets in oil, drained
• Pinch crushed red pepper flakes
• Freshly ground black pepper
• 1/4 cup DeLallo Grated Parmesan, plus more for serving

Step 1: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare kale by trimming stems, cleaning and cooking in boiling water for about 4 minutes, or until tender. Drain kale and allow kale to cool, then squeeze out to dry. Rough chop and set aside.

Step 2: In a saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on a medium setting. Add 1 clove of smashed garlic. Flavor oil with garlic, cooking for about 2 minutes until garlic begins to turn golden. Discard garlic. Add breadcrumbs and toast, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Transfer breadcrumbs to a separate dish.

Step 3: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for pasta. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Once al dente, drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water.

Step 4: In the meantime, using the same saucepan, warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-low heat. Add anchovies, red pepper flakes and 2 cloves of chopped garlic. While cooking, mash anchovies with a spoon until it dissolves into the oil, about 2 minutes. Add kale and cook until kale is warmed through, about 5 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.

Step 5: Add hot pasta and 1/2 cup reserved pasta water, if necessary to loosen sauce. Stir to combine. Cook together for 2 minutes to marry flavors. Stir in the Parmesan cheese.

Step 6: Serve topped with toasted breadcrumbs. (Serves 4 to 6)
